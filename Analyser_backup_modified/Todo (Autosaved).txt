1 - Mono/Stereo affecting..  always hear the original no matter what (or filtered).  DONE

2 - Snapshot - get rid of original.  Even if I pick big buffer I get the same buffer.. always the same 64 values being repeated.  A static value at position 63.. -0.0231. Can't recreate. 

3 - Top level revel for reporting interval. Done

4 - Snapshot and FFT both send blank on one of the channels when in MONO.  FFT off switch should overide the control values.  DONE

5 - pitch detection is important.  Single value.  Done.

6 - mel scale & bark scale.  Choose number of bars.  Done.

7 - spread(important) and centroid. Done.

8 - beatrack.. Done.


freqpeak - 4 should be smallest value

fft is it possible to send log bins?

sender send from all instances.. make oscsend be dynamic on instance name
