1 - Mono/Stereo affecting..  always hear the original no matter what (or filtered).

2 - Snapshot - get rid of original.  Even if I pick big buffer I get the same buffer.. always the same 64 values being repeated.  A static value at position 63.. -0.0231.  

3 - Top level revel for reporting interval.

4 - Snapshot and FFT both send blank on one of the channels when in MONO.  FFT off switch should overide the control values.

5 - pitch detection is important.  Single value.

6 - mel scale & bark scale.  Choose number of bars.  

7 - spread(important) and centroid.

8 - beatrack..
